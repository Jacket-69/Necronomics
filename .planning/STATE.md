# State: Necronomics Planning Memory

**Initialized:** 2026-02-27
**Last updated:** 2026-02-27

## Context Pointers

- Project context: `.planning/PROJECT.md`
- Requirements source and traceability: `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`
- Active roadmap baseline: `.planning/ROADMAP.md`

## Current Planning State

- Workflow stage: Roadmap defined from v1 requirements.
- Active milestone focus: v1 delivery planning.
- Total roadmap phases: 8
- Requirement coverage status: 43/43 v1 requirements assigned exactly once.

## Memory

- Phase model follows v1 requirement domains directly: Accounts, Categories, Transactions and Balances, Debts, Dashboard, Currency and Settings, Data Portability, UX Foundations.
- Traceability in requirements is now expected to remain synchronized with roadmap phase assignments.
- Next planning handoff should use PROJECT + REQUIREMENTS + ROADMAP as the canonical triad.
